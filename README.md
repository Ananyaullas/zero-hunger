# Zero-Hunger Surplus Food App

A **low-code web application** designed to **reallocate surplus food** using **Relay.app workflows** and **Google Sheets** as a backend database.  
The system connects food donors with recipient NGOs in real time, reducing food waste and helping fight hunger.  

---

## üìñ Project Description
This project leverages **Relay.app** and **workflow automation** to simplify food reallocation:  

- **Donors** submit surplus food details through a web form.  
- **Relay workflows** automatically record this data in a connected **Google Sheet**.  
- **Recipient NGOs** can browse and claim available food, with their actions instantly reflected in the sheet.  

This approach keeps the system **simple, lightweight, and transparent**, while avoiding the complexity of traditional full-stack databases.
